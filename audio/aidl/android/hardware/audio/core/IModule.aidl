 * Each instance of IModule corresponds to a separate audio module. The system

 * may have multiple modules due to the physical architecture, for example, it
 * can have multiple DSPs or other audio I/O units which are not interconnected
 * in hardware directly. Usually there is at least one audio module which is
 * responsible for the "main" (or "built-in") audio functionality of the
 * system. Even if the system lacks any physical audio I/O capabilities, there
 * will be a "null" audio module.
 *
 * On a typical mobile phone there is usually a main DSP module which handles
 * most of the phone's audio I/O via the built-in speakers and microphones. USB
 * audio can exist as a separate module. Some audio modules can be implemented
 * purely in software, for example, the remote submix module.

    /**
     * Set a device port of an external device into connected state.
     *
     * This method is used to inform the HAL module that an external device has
     * been connected to a device port selected using the 'id' field of the
     * input AudioPort parameter. This device port must have dynamic profiles
     * (an empty list of profiles). This port is further referenced to as "port
     * template" because it acts as a template for creating a new instance of a
     * "connected" device port which gets returned from this method.
     *
     * The input AudioPort parameter may contain any additional data obtained by
     * the system side from other subsystems. The nature of data depends on the
     * type of the connection. For example, for point-to-multipoint external
     * device connections, the input parameter may contain the address of the
     * connected external device. Another example is EDID information for HDMI
     * connections (ExtraAudioDescriptor), which can be provided by the HDMI-CEC
     * HAL module.
     *
     * It is the responsibility of the HAL module to query audio profiles
     * supported by the connected device and return them as part of the returned
     * AudioPort instance. In the case when the HAL is unable to query the
     * external device, an error must be thrown.
     *
     * Thus, the returned audio port instance is the result of combining the
     * following information:
     *  - a unique port ID generated by the HAL module;
     *  - static information from the port template;
     *  - list of audio profiles supported by the connected device;
     *  - additional data from the input AudioPort parameter.
     *
     * The HAL module must also update the list of audio routes to include the
     * ID of the instantiated connected device port. Normally, the connected
     * port allows the same routing as the port template.
     *
     * Also see notes on 'ModuleDebug.simulateDeviceConnections'.
     *
     * The following protocol is used by HAL module client for handling
     * connection of an external device:
     *  1. Obtain the list of device ports and their IDs via 'getAudioPorts'
     *     method. Select the appropriate port template using
     *     AudioDeviceDescription ('ext.device' field of AudioPort).
     *  2. Combine the ID of the port template with any additional data and call
     *     'connectExternalDevice'. The HAL module returns a new instance of
     *     AudioPort created using the rules explained above. Both
     *     'getAudioPort' and 'getAudioPorts' methods will be returning the same
     *     information for this port until disconnection.
     *  3. Configure the connected port with one of supported profiles using
     *     'setAudioPortConfig'.
     *  4. Query the list of AudioRoutes for the new AudioPort using
     *     'getAudioRoutesForAudioPort' or 'getAudioRoutes' methods.
     *
     * External devices are distinguished by the connection type and device
     * address. Calling this method multiple times to inform about connection of
     * the same external device without disconnecting it first is an error.
     *
     * The HAL module must perform validation of the input parameter and throw
     * an error if it is lacking required information, for example, when no
     * device address is specified for a point-to-multipoint external device
     * connection.
     *
     * Handling of a disconnect is done in a reverse order:
     *  1. Reset port configuration using the 'resetAudioPortConfig' method.
     *  2. Release the connected device port by calling the 'disconnectExternalDevice'
     *     method. This also removes the audio routes associated with this
     *     device port.
     *
     * @return New instance of an audio port for the connected external device.
     * @param templateIdAndAdditionalData Specifies port template ID and any
     *                                    additional data.
     * @throws EX_ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT In the following cases:
     *                             - If the template port can not be found by the ID.
     *                             - If the template is not a device port, or
     *                               it does not have dynamic profiles.
